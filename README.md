## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a simple TodoList WebApp.

We can add our daily Todo Tasks and also remove them from the list easily.

The code can be found in src folder.

App.js and TodoLists.js handles all the operations whereas index.css contains all the CSS Design.
